Presence is often framed as a personal virtue, but environment shapes behavior before intention arrives.

If products are built to pull attention continuously, asking people to "just focus" becomes unfair. Presence needs design:

1. Make noise visible.
2. Keep structure gentle enough to survive low-energy days.
3. Return agency to the user.

Flow the Moment is not about stricter control. It is about livable conditions for attention.
